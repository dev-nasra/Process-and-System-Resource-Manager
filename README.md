# Process-and-System-Resource-Manager
This Project is related to the Process Management concept of operating systems.
Like the task manager in Windows Operating Systems, we use a system monitor in Linux to manage the tasks. It displays all the processes that are active along with their memory usage. In the Resources tab, we can also check additional system statistics like CPU usage per core, memory usage, network usage, and others. The processes tab is the next; the task manager is equivalent to this. We can sort according to process name and CPU utilization.
The History of the CPU, network, and memory is shown in the Resource tab. It is beneficial for the System's Numerous troubleshooting operations. If the System monitor is running, the history is kept. Therefore, if we want to see a particular process's performance, we should ensure that it is a running process. The final tab is File Systems. It shows information about local hard discs and partitions. The directory shows where the division is located, and the device shows how a system detects it.
